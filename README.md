# Mouse_Mover
This program moves mouse cursor for chosen offset with the given timeout. When the code is executed, the program starts by importing the modules. Then, it creates the threading event and thread object. Next, it defines the necessary functions for mouse movement, stopping the movement, and updating the initial position. After that, the GUI window is created along with the required GUI elements. The event binding and button command are set up. Finally, the GUI event loop is started, allowing the user to interact with the program.
